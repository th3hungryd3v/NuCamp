<!-- Accessing DOM Nodes in JavaScript Through Node Relationships -->
<!-- Node Relationship Properties:
        .parentNode - gives the parent of a node, 
        .firstChild & .lastChild - gives the first and last child of a node,
        .nextSibling - the very next sibling of a node, 
        .previousSibling - immediate previous sibling of a node,
        Note: There's only ever one parent node for each .next/.previous node
        However, a node can have more than one child.
        .childNodes[] - will give an iterable called a NodeList,
        containing all child nodes of a node - use bracket notation
        with the index to access each child in the list, ex. .childNodes[0] for the
        first child, .childNodes[1] for the second child, etc..,-->

<!-- This will be our entry point: let node = document.body
The variable can have any name but we'll use node for this demo
document = the object that will be running the code
.body = points the node to the body element inside the document 
We can do this with the body node because there's only ever one valid body element in an HTML document.
So, you couldn't do something like: document.div -->
<!-- Now we have our entry point stored in a variable called node -->
<!-- Note: Because all nodes are connected to all other nodes, we can access ALL the nodes in this document through this one, aka "Traversing the DOM"
Meaning: Travelling the document via the node connections -->
<body> <!-- let = node (Our entry point)-->
