        // Notice the keyword document:
        // document references the HTML document that is running the code
        // it's data type is that of an object && is itself considered a node in the DOM tree, the very first one, aka the root node
        // all of the following functions use the document as the entry node(point) and can traverse the DOM using node relations
        // Note: for this demo all the functions are accessing the same node, but showcasing four different ways to do it
        function changeColor1() {
            // this function changes the color of the 3rd child of the second child of the first child of the document to red by using the .childNodes[$] property
            // .style.color == <p style="color: red;">
            // This is one of the worst ways to access a node because if you add or delete any of the elements on the page the nodes will also change, which may break your page.
            document.childNodes[1].childNodes[2].childNodes[3].style.color = 'red';
        }

        function changeColor2() {
            // this function changes the color of the first p element node in the index using the getElementsByTagName method in the document to orange
            // .getElementsByTagName will look for all elements with a particular tag name that you pass in as the argument
            // this method will return a list of every element with that tag name, even if there's only one
            // we can access a particular element using bracket notation with an index number, here we choose the very first p element and style it with the color orange
            // this method can be good to use if you want to target every element of a particular type in a document
            // However, if you're trying to target a single element, this would not be the most efficient way, since you would have to know the order of the entire document
            // and again if you change something, you may break it
            document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].style.color = 'orange';

        function changeColor3() {
            // this function changes the color of the element with the ID of textToChange using the .getElementById method with the argument of the element's ID(textToChange) to blue
            // this is much more specific and it targets the element directly
            // since HTML documents should only use 1 Id throughout a webpage
            // this would be a one way to target a node specifically, which works well
            // this is actually the way they used to target specific nodes, so you'll still see code like this in the wild, but the preffered way to target specific nodes nowadays:
            document.getElementById('textToChange').style.color = 'blue';
        }

        function changeColor4() {
            // this function changes the color of the element using the .querySelector method with CSS selectors as an argument to green
            // here we target the CSS selector #textToChange which is the ID of the first <p> element in the document
            // If you need to target multiple elements with matching selectors use the .querySelectorAll method instead
            // this method is quite flexible and powerful, because you can use any CSS selector, you can also use more complex ones as well
            // Note: this will only return the first element it finds that matches the selector
            // document.querySelector('#textToChange').style.color = 'green';
            document.querySelectorAll('button')[1].style.background = 'blue';
            // we can also access different properties in the document using dot notation:
            // in this example, we'll access the hidden property and give it the value of true, when you click on the button what happens?
